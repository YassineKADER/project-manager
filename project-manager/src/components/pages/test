Dear Amadeus Moroccan Support Team,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Yassine Kader, and I represent Cyber AI Space, a software development company. We are currently working on an application that aims to provide comprehensive travel services to our users. As part of our app development, we are interested in integrating the Amadeus API to access information about cities and airports in Morocco.

However, we have encountered some challenges when attempting to retrieve data related to Moroccan cities and airports. We are unable to retrieve the necessary information despite following the documentation and guidelines provided. We believe there might be specific considerations or requirements for accessing data in Morocco that we are not aware of.

Therefore, I am reaching out to your esteemed team to kindly request your support and guidance in addressing these issues. We would greatly appreciate it if you could provide us with more information on how we can effectively utilize the Amadeus API in Morocco or if there are any additional steps or configurations required for accessing Moroccan city and airport data.

Our goal is to ensure that our application offers accurate and up-to-date travel information for our users in Morocco. Your assistance in resolving these issues would be invaluable to us and greatly contribute to the success of our project.

Thank you very much for your attention to this matter. We look forward to your prompt response and any guidance or solutions you can provide. If you require any further information or have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.
